# projects

This is a compilation of projects I have made for school, and I am currently working on a much more complicated Java scheduling application that pulls from a SQL database.

When I have completed that one, you can bet I will add it here!

I am trying to post my projects for the sole purpose of adding them to my portfolio website.

I am still a student and these were my first coding projects ever, so I am open to any advice and expertise you can offer.

Thank you for your time :)
